Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jewel Chin
## About Me

I am currently a final year student in Nanyang Technological University, College of Computing and Data Science, majoring in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.

I really enjoy creative work in the tech space, including front end development, web design, UI/UX, data visualisations. Other than that, my recent credit-bearing internship from January to May ignited my interest in exploring innovative deep learning algorithms across various contexts as well. With a diverse range of interests, I aim to find a niche that intersects these fields. 

In addition to my tech pursuits, I run a small online apparel art business called String of Kisses, which started as a hobby and has evolved into a personal brand. I am currently developing the front end of my website using a Hydrogen, a Remix/React-based framework, which you can view at www.stringofkisses.com (best experienced on desktop). This venture gives me the chance to explore a unique artistic approach in the fashion/e-commerce world, where I merge my skills in traditional craft with technical expertise to produce a distinctive and creative vision.

## My Skillsets
- Languages: Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript/Typescript, Java, C
- Data Science/ ML/ AI Libraries: Tensorflow (I have dabbled with pytorch before, but i am more familiar with tensorflow), pandas, matplotlib, keras, numpy
- Software Framework: Shopify Hydrogen (Remix/React-based framework), Dash Plotly, Bootstrap (currently learning)
- Software Libraries: React.js, Framer Motion, P5.js (currently learning)
